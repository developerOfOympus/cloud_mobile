# cloud

This is a project to use my computer storage, something like a cloud that only works in my private network.  
The frontend will be builded in React in the future, but for now I am programming this mobile application in Flutter, because i want to download movies in my PC and then be able to watch it in my cellphone.

The backend is under development in Node.js, here in github is that project too.
